## What I learned

While building this project, I embarked on my first full-stack journey, transitioning from frontend development to working with the backend. The journey was both exciting and challenging, and I learned a lot along the way:

1. **Frontend Gracefulness:** As I crafted the frontend, I encountered various errors, but I embraced each challenge as an opportunity to learn. With useState and other hooks, along with Bootstrap for styling, I built an intuitive and responsive user interface.

2. **Backend Confidence:** Setting up the Express and MongoDB server initially seemed daunting, but I persisted. Working on controllers for API calls and defining routes took time, but I gained confidence as I overcame each obstacle.

3. **Expanded Toolkit:** Throughout the project, I explored additional React concepts like useEffect, useContext, and React Router DOM for seamless navigation between components and managing state effectively.

4. **Deployment Know-How:** Deploying the backend server was a crucial step in making the application accessible online. I learned to configure the production environment, manage dependencies, and ensure security with HTTPS and authentication.

5. **Continuous Improvement:** I adopted a proactive approach to monitoring and logging server performance, identifying potential issues early on and implementing CI/CD pipelines for smooth and automated deployments.

6. **The Joy of Problem-Solving:** Despite encountering obstacles, I discovered the joy of problem-solving and the satisfaction that comes with finding solutions to complex challenges.

7. **Version Control and Rollbacks:** I grasped the importance of version control not only for the codebase but also for server configurations, facilitating easy rollbacks if needed.

Overall, this project marked a significant milestone in my journey as a full-stack developer. Combining frontend and backend expertise, I can now confidently bring complete web applications to life and tackle new challenges with enthusiasm.
